		                        <h5>At Delhi University Model United Nations, we believe that the UN is the paragon for diplomacy between states, but while it occupies a central position, it cannot be termed as the cornerstone of all statecraft because alternative forums and regional organisations play an equally important, if not more, role in influencing the patch-work that is a world order, but are withdrawn from popular discourse.&nbsp;
		<br>
		<br>We believe it is essential, now after 70 years of UN’s existence and amidst the discussion on its reform, to objectively assess the organisation and attempt to look beyond the UN. This will not only make one appreciate the work of the organisation, but also get a holistic understanding of how underlying currents of diplomacy at corroborative bodies culminate into the tenets of the UN.&nbsp;
		<br>In this spirit, we declare the committees to be simulated at DUMUN ’16 which defines our theme for the conference, looking around the United Nations. These are as follows:
		<br>1. <a href="unreform.php">Open-Forum on UN Reform</a>
		<br>2. <a href="osce.php">Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a>
		<br>3. <a href="sco.php">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a>
		<br>4. <a href="inter-parliament.php">Inter-Parliamentary Union &nbsp;</a><br></h5>
