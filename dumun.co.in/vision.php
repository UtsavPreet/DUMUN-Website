		</b><br>
		<br>Its an honour to welcome you to the sixth edition of Delhi University Model United Nations Conference - a conference that has, in the past, played a pivotal role in the development of Model UNs as a co-curricular activity in the nation. DUMUN stands for certain values, including innovation, professionalism, and quality, and DUMUN ’16 is an endeavour to further these, and to induce a structural transformation in this activity to become a complete educational experience, where we can provide a learning space for students to interact with each other and deliberate issues of common concern and most importantly, change and be changed.&nbsp;
		<br>In the legacy of the previous 5 conferences, every year the conference has grown in substantially different ways, and this year too, we are hoping to redefine how Model UNs are conducted. We believe that the United Nations has for long been discussed at length, but at MUNs we hide behind our country-representations and hard-lined policies to really objectively assess the body. Our flagship simulation, the Open-Forum on UN Reform, aims to remove all unnecessary obstacles to enable the participants to really view the UN dispassionately and disinterestedly, to appreciate its immense value but also chalk out plans for its reformation.&nbsp;
		<br>It is also rather interesting to note that the UN is not the breeding ground for all diplomatic negotiations and international politics, but it more or less witnesses pre-prepared plans made by the participating nations in other forums. In this way, the nations start practising the art of diplomacy much before they arrive at the UN meetings, by making their settlements at alternative forums and other regional organisations. It is this type of regional or alliance-driven diplomacy that culminates into the final product that we see coming out of the UN. It is keeping in mind the importance of these forums, that we have chosen other committees in accordance to our theme of looking around (or beyond) the UN.&nbsp;
		<br>The School Outreach Programme, started in 2014, will be one of our primary focus areas for this year’s conference. It is a means by which we can bring the university students in touch with younger students, to engage the budding minds in this activity. This year, we will are proud to initiate the College Outreach Programme to bring the students of the Delhi University together in the spirit of a pan-DU event.&nbsp;
		<br>We hope to attain the correct balance between our existing values and our new concepts to deliver a successful and holistic event for all participants.&nbsp;
		<br>Regards,&nbsp;
