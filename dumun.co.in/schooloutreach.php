		                    <h6 class="uppercase mb32"><cop@dumun.co.in>School Outreach Programme is an initiative of Delhi University Model United Nations to train students for Model UN conferences. Taking forward this initiative, the Programme envisions introducing Model UNs to students across India, and assisting them in making their conference experience one of understanding and learning. Trainings will be conducted at beginner and advanced level depending on the needs of the institution. At the beginner level the training encompasses educating students about United Nations, Model United Nations and Rules of Procedure. At the advanced level the training focuses on equipping students to deal with specific agendas, themes and skills such as – Human Rights, International Law, World Trade and Economics, Lobbying and Alliances, Documentation etc. In the previous sessions, we have reached out to more than 15 institutions, and this year we are hoping to further the reach to more than 20 schools.
		<br>Who is eligible for a free-of-cost training?
		<br>All basic trainings will be provided completely devoid of any charges, however DUMUN has always advocated inclusiveness in Model UN Conferences and that requires participation from students and institutions from diverse economic backgrounds. Institutions may be eligible for a free-of-cost advanced training session by the same expert staff which trains every other school if the per-quarter fee charged by the institution is less than Rs. 5000. The Programme charges a humble fee of Rs. 100 per student for a day’s training from the institutions which do not fulfil the abovementioned criteria.
		<br>Who are the trainers?
		<br>Regarded names in the MUN circuit are part of the DUMUN staff such as Abhinav Verma and Harsh Vardhan Yadav. Renowned MUNers such as Hisham Ahmed Rizvi, Rajat Rai Handa and Akshay Sharma have also contributed to the growth of Model UNs as our staff members in the past. Our trainers have not only trained students across India but also students from Europe and China. This year we further aim to associate ourselves with more experienced MUNers who share our vision, and value quality while training.
		<br>How can institutions apply?
		<br>Interested institutes can request us to book trainings by writing to us at  <span class="email"><u>sop@dumun.co.in</u>.<span> Our staff will try its best to accommodate each request.
