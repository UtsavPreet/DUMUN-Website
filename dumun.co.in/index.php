		                <p class="lead mb40">Welcome to the sixth session of Delhi University Model United Nations - a conference that has been hosting India's best class of debaters since its inception in 2010 as India's first MUN Conference at the University scale.  
		<br>In its five years of existence, DUMUN has hosted over 1600 delegates and 120 Executive Board members, including an International presentation at WEMUN Expo China, making it India's largest conference of its kind. 
		<br>DUMUN is organized by students of University of Delhi, India's largest and most prestigious University established in 1920. At Delhi University, we want to host a conference that could give to its participants an experience that is as unique as India is.  
		<br>This April, the DUMUN Secretariat will host delegates from around the country, and the world, and better the already high standards that have been set in previous years.&nbsp;</p>
