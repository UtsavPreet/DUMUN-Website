		            <h3>INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION</h3>
		            <h5>World’s first permanent forum for political negotiations, the organization was initially meant for individual parliamentarians but has transformed into a forum for parliaments of sovereign states with 163 members and 10 associate members. Formed in 1889, it predates the League of Nations and the UN, and served as a model for most modern international organizations. Today, its visibility has seen stark reduction, but nonetheless it exerts its influence on a variety of issues, including setting standards for democratic set-ups, and works in close cooperation with the UN. At DUMUN, we aim at restoring IPU’s glory and see how it impacts modern diplomacy. &nbsp;<br></h5>
