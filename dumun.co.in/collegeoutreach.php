		                    <h6 class="uppercase mb32">College Outreach Programme is an initiative by DUMUN to reach out to different colleges within the University to make every student of the University an intrinsic part of this pan-DU event. Under this programme, the DUMUN organizing team intends to visit every college to interact with the students, inform them about Model UNs and specifically DUMUN, discuss international issues and conduct some activities.
		<br>We believe that it is important to listen to the views of opinionated individuals and take their constructive inputs to create an event that caters to their requirements in the best manner. This initiative seeks to ensure that DUMUN represents the diverse and unique perspectives of DU students and is a product of their inclusive as well as collective efforts.
		<br>How can institutions apply?
		<br>Interested institutes can request us to book trainings or delegation request  by writing to us at <span class="lowercase"><u>cop@dumun.co.in</u>.</span> Our staff will try its best to accommodate each request.
